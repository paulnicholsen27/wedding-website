Now Paul and Jason are relying on her to bring the smackdown on any wedding vendor that doesn't do what he or she is supposed to.  (Seriously, don't cross Megan.) </div>

            <div class="party_text">Frank is Jason's brother-in-law, and father to the three adorable monkeys below. Paul and Jason included him in the wedding not just because he's important to them, but also because they figure there will be lots of opportunities to make him uncomfortable.</div>
