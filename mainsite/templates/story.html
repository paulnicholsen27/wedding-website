            <p>It's not really an understatement to say that Paul and Jason are not your typical couple.  Which is good, because typical couples are boring and lame.</p>

    <p class="story">Paul and Jason met out in Chelsea late one December night.  Jason was wearing shorts, despite the fact that it was freezing out.  When they learned that they lived only a few blocks from each other in Astoria, Paul seized the opportunity... to split cab fare home.  Jason asked for Paul's number--which confused Paul--but Paul gave it to him anyway.</p>
    <p class="story">Jason began texting Paul, but Paul was kind of a jerk (surprise!) and blew him off for a month.  Finally, Paul agreed to go out with him, figuring he'd at least get a free dinner out of it.  By then, Paul wasn't completely sure he remembered what Jason looked like, so he made sure to show up at The Grand Cafe first.  While waiting, he called some of his friends, telling them he was about to go out on a date and although he wasn't too into the guy, he figured he'd give it a try.  Clearly, instant love.</p>
    <p class="story">But the date went better than either could have expected (and yes, Paul did end up recognizing Jason as soon as he showed up).  The boys spent most of the evening making rude comments about other patrons at the restaurant, and Paul gave Jason the warning to never believe a word he said.  Jason would prove to forget that warning immediately (Paul claimed to be Kosher, despite eating a bacon cheeseburger while saying it) and many more times over the years.</p>
    <p class="story">Through quite a bit of adversity and struggle--given that both Paul and Jason are completely insane--somehow they made it through six-plus years and the boys realized they were stuck with each other for the long haul.  Jason's birthday was approaching and Paul was set to pop the question.  He made plans to go out to a fancy dinner in Manhattan, but Jason decided to make things difficult and insist they just stay home, order in, and watch television.  They compromised on a local Astoria restaurant, Locale.  Paul secretly called ahead and reserved a private booth in a secluded section of the restaurant, but when they got there Jason demanded they sit by the window crammed in with a bunch of strangers.  After dinner, Paul gave Jason his first birthday present (an Adventure Time action figure), and pretended to drop the next present under the table.  Paul got down on one knee as if to search for it, but instead pulled out a ring and asked Jason to spend the rest of their lives together.</p>
    <p class="story">At least until one of them murders the other.</p>
