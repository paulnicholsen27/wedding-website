wedding-website
===============

This website was built using Python/Django, with some jQuery thrown in for funsies.  This is my first real attempt at a full website on my own (more or less) done both as a learning exercise as well as the fact that I'm getting married on September 27, 2014.  Yippee.

Feedback and suggestions greatly encouraged, whether you are a programmer and want to submit a pull request or a general user that thinks something could be improved.  As a learning exercise, I'm still up for hearing "Hey, your website would be super-nifty if it did {{random feature request}}."

The website was built to be optimized on Chrome, and should work on most major browsers.  If you see a problem please [let me know](mailto:pnichols104@gmail.com), although if you tell me you are using Internet Explorer, especially a version pre-7, I will probably just mock you.  Spend thirty seconds and [get a modern browser](https://www.google.com/intl/en/chrome/browser/).
